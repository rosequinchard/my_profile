      <h2>paintings</h2>
      <p>
    I love art and going to museums, there is nothing more inspiring and captivating. My two favorite painters will always be Vincent Van Gogh and Claude Monet. Their paintings make me dream and are absolutely beautiful.

    <h2>my Australian trip</h2>
    <p>
    I went alone to Australia when I was 16 and it was the most incredible experience of my life.I can't explain everything I experienced in Australia but it was a life changing trip. You get up in the morning to surf at sunrise, you meet wild kangaroos on the way and you have a smoothie in front of the incredible Australian landscape
